Linux Assignment Commands: 
Step 1: Open a terminal on your machine.
Since I have used gitbash I opened git bash on my system.

Step 2: Create a new directory called "linux-assignment"
To do this we use the make directory command i.e. mkdir ~/linux-assignment
This creates a new directory called linux-assignment

Step 3: Navigate into "linux assignment"
TO do this we use the change directory command i.e. cd ~/linux-assignment

Step 4: Create a new file called instructions.txt 
Now we create a file using command line text editor nano. We run the command : nano instructions.txt This creates a instructions.txt 
file and opens it. Inside we write whatever we want, in this case "hello world!"

Step 5: Display contents of "instructions.txt"
For this we use cat command followed by file name
cat instructions.txt
This gives us content inside of the file.

Step 6: Remane instructions.txt to greetings.txt
For this we use the command mv to rename
mv instructions.txt greetings.txt

Step 7: Copy greetings.txt to a new file called salutations.txt
For this we the cp command which copies content of first file into new file specified by us
cp greetings.txt salutations.txt

Step 8: Delete greetings.txt
To delete a file we use the rm command followed by file name
rm greetings.txt
